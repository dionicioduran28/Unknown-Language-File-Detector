# Unknown-Language-File-Detector
In this project  a tool was created to predict what language a document is written in given a  sample set of known documents. The tool will be able to use various techniques to make  guesses. The basis for each of the techniques will be looking at frequencies of trigrams. A  trigram is a three character subsequence of the document. The program will be limited to a short list of languages and each language will have a small set of training  data (documents for which the language is known).
