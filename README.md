# Unknown-Language-File-Detector
In this project  a tool was created to predict what language a document is written in given a  sample set of known documents. The tool will be able to use various techniques to make  guesses. The basis for each of the techniques will be looking at frequencies of trigrams. A  trigram is a three character subsequence of the document. The program will be limited to a short list of languages and each language will have a small set of training  data (documents for which the language is known). 

In order to properly run this program as is, please download all corresponding .txt files as as well as the .py file into the same directory. Additionally, if you wish to change the files being used in the program, simply modify the "languages_copy.txt" file with the associated language and .txt file names you wish to analyze and save into the directory with your new files.
